I'm Martin O'Leary, and this is my blog.

If you've heard of me, it's probably either because of my participation in [Kaggle][kaggle], a website for competitive data mining, or through my series of posts on [Eurovision statistics][eurovision]. I'm a recovering pure mathematician, and I enjoy messing about with data analysis slightly more than is probably healthy. I strongly dislike the term "data science", but I don't have a better one.

I'm a research fellow in the [Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences][aoss] at the [University of Michigan][umich], which tends to impress people at parties. My current research (with [Jeremy Bassis][jeremy]) looks at interactions between glaciers and the oceans, as well as stochastic and granular models for ice flow. Previously I worked at the [Scott Polar Research Institute][spri] at the [University of Cambridge][cam], where I got my PhD under [Poul Christoffersen][poul] on "[Frontal processes on tidewater glaciers][thesis]".

I have a [Twitter][twitter] and a [GitHub][github]. You can also [email me][email] if that doesn't feel like a weird social imposition.

### Some of my proudest achievements

 *  The White House once [compared me][whitehouse] to Newton and Einstein.
 *  I once came second in a phone-in poll on [CUR1350 (now CamFM)][camfm] to find the sexiest voice in Cambridge.
 *  I was a semifinalist in the [2009 series][uc09] of the quiz show [University Challenge][uc], during which [Jeremy Paxman][jp] confided that he "enjoyed Mr O'Leary's bullshit".
 *  I once wrote a [blog post][evfinal] which was read by over 2% of the population of Malta
